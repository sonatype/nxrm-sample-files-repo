# You should not use Dynamic Volume Provisioning as it will cause scheduling problems if AKS provisions the Nexus Repository pod and the volume in different AZs. 
# The volume used must be the local volume attached as illustrated in the sample persistent volume YAML file. 
#
# Note: This YAML file is just an example and cannot be used as-is. 
# You must fill it out with the appropriate information for your deployment to be able to use it.
