# If you require your clients to access more than one Docker Repository, you must use an external load balancer (e.g., NGINX) as a reverse proxy instead of this ingress for Docker YAML.
# In the following YAML, <scheme> should typically be set to internal.
#
# Note: This YAML file is just an example and cannot be used as-is. 
# You must fill it out with the appropriate information for your deployment to be able to use it.
